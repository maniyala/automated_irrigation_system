# Overview of Smart Irrigation system 

This project is sensor-based application for sensing the humidity of any plant and setting up irrigation to automatically water it using water pump with hose. So, restoring water as needed, while minimizing excess water use, it automatically turns the water pump on when the moisture level in the soil is very low and turns the water pump off when the moisture level reaches the threshold value. 


**Objective**

To design an automatic irrigation system thereby saving time & power for the farmer.

To design a proto-type and test it on small scale so that we can create an effective solution for the problems on large scale.

Eliminating human interaction as much as possible in the process.

Providing the plants with water only when they require.

Can be implemented in perennial plant irrigation land and gardening land by reducing manual work. 

Providing a more modular system for easy upgrades.

Easy monitoring from anywhere in the world.
