# Overview


This project is sensor-based application for sensing the humidity of any plant and setting up irrigation to automatically water it using water pump with hose. So, it automatically turns the water pump on when the moisture level in the soil is very low and turns the water pump off when the moisture level reaches the threshold value.

**Area of utility**

This project can be implemented in perennial plant irrigation land and gardening land by reducing manual work. 


**Connections**

soil moisture sensor A0 to analog pin 0 of arduino 

GROUND to ground pin of arduino uno

Vcc to pin 5V of arduino uno
